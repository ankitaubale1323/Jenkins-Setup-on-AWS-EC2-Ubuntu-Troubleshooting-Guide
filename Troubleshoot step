üöÄ Prerequisites
AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance (22.04 recommended).

SSH access to your EC2 instance.

sudo privileges on the server.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Update & Install Java (Java 17 Required)
Jenkins (2.414+) requires Java 17 or higher. At first, Java 11 was installed, which caused this error:



Running with Java 11 from /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64, which is older than the minimum required version (Java 17).
Fix: Install Java 17

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
Verify the version:

bash

java -version
‚úÖ Should return: openjdk version "17..."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Jenkins Repository & Install
bash

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
3Ô∏è‚É£ Resolve Directory Permission Issues
Before starting Jenkins, ensure directories exist and have correct permissions:

bash

sudo mkdir -p /var/log/jenkins /var/lib/jenkins /var/run/jenkins
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/log/jenkins /var/lib/jenkins /var/run/jenkins
4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Jenkins Service
Attempt to start Jenkins:

bash

sudo systemctl start jenkins
If the service fails, check the status:

bash

sudo systemctl status jenkins
If you see errors like:

sql

Start request repeated too quickly.
jenkins.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
‚û°Ô∏è Usually this is due to Java version mismatch or missing directories, both fixed by earlier steps.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Jenkins Run (Debugging)
If the service still fails, manually run Jenkins to check logs:

bash

sudo su - jenkins
java -jar /usr/share/java/jenkins.war --httpPort=8080
If Java is still below version 17, install the correct version as shown in Step 1.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Access Jenkins UI
Open your browser:

cpp

http://<Your-EC2-Public-IP>:8080
Unlock Jenkins with:

bash

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Paste the password into the Jenkins web interface.

üß† Common Issues & Fixes

Issue	Solution
Java 11 detected, Jenkins won't start.	Upgrade to Java 17 (sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y).
jenkins.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'	Check Java version, directory permissions, logs.
sudo fails for jenkins user.	Switch back to ubuntu user, perform sudo commands.
Jenkins web not accessible on :8080.	Check ufw firewall and AWS EC2 security group ‚Äî allow port 8080.
